BASIC IDEA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The basic idea of the web application I have going to make is that 
users will be able to get notifications at the time of any calamity like
earthquakes, floods and hurricanes by getting alerts from anyone who gets
to know of the calamity quickly by getting a notification in the form of
images posted online or any common text broadcasts according to their 
location.
Once the user is informed of the calamity, the user follows the emergency steps to be 
taken during the time of the calamity.We also incorporate government agencies 
to notify in case of a hurricane or flood beforehand through the application 
and also provide various fast access emergency numbers in the application.

In all, the alertness and conciousness of the people and government agencies 
near the calamity area can help to broadcast the calamities like hurricanes and
floods while earthquakes can also be known of by the same alongwith the help of the 
gyroscopic sensor and accelerometer in a smartphone.
