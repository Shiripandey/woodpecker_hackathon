BASIC IDEA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I developed a disaster management website using Flask, incorporating machine learning algorithms for accurate disaster prediction. The site provides real-time notifications and alerts to affected areas, while offering safety and precautionary measures to enhance disaster preparedness and response.
The basic idea of the web application I made is to make sure that users will be able to get notifications at the time of any calamity likeearthquakes, floods and hurricanes by getting alerts from anyone who gets
to know of the calamity quickly by getting a notification in the form of images posted online or any common text broadcasts.
Once the user is informed of the calamity, the user follows the emergency steps to be taken during the time of the calamity.I have also incorporated government agencies to notify in case of a hurricane or flood beforehand through the application and also provide various fast access emergency numbers in the application.
